## Difficulties

During the development of our project, we encountered several technical challenges that required  patience and persistence.

Firstly, detecting touches on the joysticks presented significant challenges. 

The creation of the joysticks was also not a simple task. 

Another challenge was rotating the player according to the joystick direction. 

Finally, ensuring that the bullet fired in the correct direction the player was facing was particularly difficult.
